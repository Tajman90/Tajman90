## 🚀 About Me 
 I am a data analyst that specialize in transforming complex data into meaningful insights that support informed business decisions. With strong proficiency in SQL, Excel, and DAX, I focus on robust data preparation and analysis.

I also develop clear, dynamic dashboards in Power BI and Tableau that communicate insights effectively to stakeholders. My work is driven by precision, clarity, and a commitment to delivering high-quality analytical solutions.

When I'm not working with data, I enjoy matching and playing football, reading, traveling, mentoring others. I love the "aha!" moment when data reveals something new and useful.
